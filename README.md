# AWS CloudFormation Service Broker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker.png)](https://travis-ci.org/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker)

This is an **experimental** [Cloud Foundry Service Broker](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html) for [Amazon CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

## Disclaimer

This is **NOT** presently a production ready Service Broker. This is a work in progress. It is suitable for experimentation and may not become supported in the future.

## Installation

### Locally

Using the standard `go install` (you must have [Go](https://golang.org/) already installed in your local machine):

```
$ go install github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker
$ cloudformation-broker -port=3000 -config=<path-to-your-config-file>
```

### Cloud Foundry

The broker can be deployed to an already existing [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) installation:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker.git
$ cd cloudformation-broker
```

Modify the [included manifest file](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/manifest.yml) to include your AWS credentials and the [sample configuration file](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/config-sample.json) to add/update the AWS CloudFormation template URL. Then you can push the broker to your [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) environment:

```
$ cp config-sample.json config.json
$ cf push cloudformation-broker
```

### Docker

If you want to run the AWS CloudFormation Service Broker on a Docker container, you can use the [cfplatformeng/cloudformation-broker](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/cfplatformeng/cloudformation-broker/) Docker image.

```
$ docker run -d --name cloudformation-broker -p 3000:3000 \
  -e AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-aws-access-key-id> \
  -e AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-aws-secret-access-key> \
  cfplatformeng/cloudformation-broker
```

The Docker image cames with an [embedded sample configuration file](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/config-sample.json). If you want to override it and/or modify the sample AWS CloudFormation template to use, you can create the Docker image with you custom configuration file by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker.git
$ cd cloudformation-broker
$ bin/build-docker-image
```

### BOSH

This broker can be deployed using the [AWS Service Broker BOSH Release](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/aws-broker-boshrelease).

## Configuration

Refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md) instructions for details about configuring this broker.

This broker gets the AWS credentials from the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. It requires a user with some [CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) permissions. Refer to the [iam_policy.json](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/iam_policy.json) file to check what actions the user must be allowed to perform. Additional permissions might be required depending on the resources used by CloudFormation templates. For example, the provided [sample S3 CloudFormation template](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/sample-s3-cftemplate.json) requires the permissions specified at the [iam_sample_s3_cftemplate.json](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/iam_sample_s3_cftemplate.json) file.

## Usage

### Managing Service Broker

Configure and deploy the broker using one of the above methods. Then:

1. Check that your Cloud Foundry installation supports [Service Broker API Version v2.6 or greater](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html#changelog)
2. [Register the broker](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html#register-broker) within your Cloud Foundry installation;
3. [Make Services and Plans public](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/access-control.html#enable-access);
4. Depending on your Cloud Foundry settings, you migh also need to create/bind an [Application Security Group](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/app-sec-groups.html) to allow access to the AWS Resources created by the AWS CloudFormation Stack.

### Integrating Service Instances with Applications

Application Developers can start to consume the services using the standard [CF CLI commands](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html).

Depending on the [broker configuration](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/cloudformation-broker/blob/master/CONFIGURATION.md#cloudformation-broker-configuration), Application Depevelopers can send arbitrary parameters on certain broker calls:

#### Provision

Provision calls support optional [arbitrary parameters](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-create). These parameters will be passed to the CloudFormation Stack as input parameters.

#### Update

Update calls support optional [arbitrary parameters](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/managing-services.html#arbitrary-params-update). These parameters will be passed to the CloudFormation Stack as input parameters.
